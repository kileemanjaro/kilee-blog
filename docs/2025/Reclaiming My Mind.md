**Reclaiming My Mind: How Fiction Reshaped My Focus**

  

Have you ever had a thought come out of nowhere, slam into your awareness, and take over everything? Like an interrogation scene in an action movie—sudden, intense, and impossible to ignore.

  

Heart racing.

  

Palms sweating.

  

Breath—gone.

  

**Intrusive thoughts.**

  

They don’t just occupy space; they **seize control**.

  

For a long time, I believed the best way to manage them was to remain **rooted in reality**. I read **non-fiction**, collected tools, and leaned on research—attempting to ground myself in **hard facts and logic**. I thought that if I could stack my brain with enough knowledge, I could **outthink the thoughts**.

  

It felt like a game of **mental whack-a-mole**—relentless, exhausting, unwinnable.

  

And somewhere along the way, **my imagination began to atrophy**. I lost the ability to **conjure images freely**, to slip into a world that wasn’t built on **stress, rumination, or problem-solving**.

  

Now, I think I’ve found a way back in.

  

There are many paths forward. But for me, **non-fiction is no longer the only door**.

  

**When the Mind Won’t Sit Still**

  

Here’s what neuroscience tells us:

• The brain naturally **oscillates between focus and daydreaming**—we aren’t built for constant, linear attention.

• The **Default Mode Network (DMN)**—responsible for creativity, self-awareness, and emotional processing—**activates when we let our minds wander**.

• **Suppressing thoughts makes them stronger**—a psychological effect known as the **rebound phenomenon**.

  

The mind **needs movement**. It **needs a place to go**.

  

So what happens when we force it to stay still? It **rebels**. It creates stories of its own.

  

Not the kind you control. Not the kind you would choose. But the kind that **demand your attention, whether you like it or not**.

  

**Why Fiction is the Fix I Didn’t See Coming**

  

I’ve always been good at **imagining worst-case scenarios**. That part of my brain? **Flawless.** But if you’d asked me to **visualize a peaceful place? A safe space?**

  

**Nothing. Static.**

  

I used to sink so deeply into books that I could **smell the ocean air in a seaside story**. Then, somewhere along the way, I stopped. I told myself **non-fiction was better, more practical**. Maybe it started in university, when my brain felt **overloaded just trying to retain enough to get by**.

  

But what if I’d been **training my mind in the wrong direction**?

  

Brute force is one way to handle intrusive thoughts. But what if there’s a softer, more **intentional way**?

  

What if intrusive thoughts—**as unsettling as they are**—aren’t just **random disruptions**, but **a misfired attempt at creativity**? And if my brain is already **capable of creating alternate realities**, why not **choose the ones I step into**?

  

**Relearning How to Let My Mind Travel**

  

Right now, I’m reading **Erica Bauermeister’s _The Scent Keeper_**—a book where scent isn’t just a detail, but **a language, a memory, a way of making sense of the world**.

  

And without meaning to, I’ve started noticing scents differently, too.

• The **sharp cold** in my nostrils when I crack open a window on a winter morning.

• The **sting of raw garlic** clinging to my fingers as I chop it for dinner.

• The way a room **still holds the scent of someone who just left**—a signature in the air.

  

I always thought fiction was **just entertainment**, something **contained to the moment**.

  

But now? It’s **changing how I experience the world**.

  

Scents have always been like **songs on the radio** for me—**immediate, evocative, stirring emotion before I can name it**. Right now, they still **overwhelm me**—too much, too strong, before I can **find meaning in them**.

  

But I can feel the shift. With time, I know it will become **more nuanced, more layered**—like how **Emmeline, the main character, learns to navigate scent over time**.

  

And suddenly, I realize:

  

This is **focus**.

  

Not **forced**. Not something I have to **grip onto with both hands**. Not another **mental battle to win**.

  

Just **attention, gently placed**.

  

Not just **noticing**, but **feeling**.

  

The pull of scent in my breath. The way it lingers in my chest. The way it **shapes the space around me before I even register it**.

  

And **oddly enough**, intrusive thoughts do the same thing.

  

But in **the opposite way**.

  

**The Parallel Between Imagination and Intrusive Thoughts**

  

Intrusive thoughts **force me into my body**—into **all of my senses**—but without the gentleness. Without the **choice**.

  

They don’t **invite wonder or curiosity**. They **overwhelm**. They **demand attention**. They leave **no room to move**.

  

But fiction? Fiction **gives me the space to engage with my senses—on my own terms**.

  

And maybe that’s the difference.

  

Intrusive thoughts **pull me in against my will**. Imagination **lets me choose how and when I step inside**.

  

I can’t stop my mind from **wandering**. But I can **decide where it goes**.

  

**Rethinking Focus**

  

For years, I tried to **fight** intrusive thoughts with logic. Tried to **force my mind to hold still**.

  

But **the brain doesn’t work that way**.

  

So I’m done **fighting it**. Instead, I’m **guiding it**.

  

Because if my mind **is always going to wander**, then I might as well **decide where it goes**.

  

I don’t just want **focus**. I want **presence**. I want **curiosity**.

  

And maybe, just maybe, that’s how I finally put my **Mind in Focus**.
